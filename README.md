### Introduction
As social media usage grows across all age groups, the great majority of individuals rely on this crucial medium for day-to-day communication. Because of the pervasiveness of social media, cyberbullying may affect anybody at any time or from any location, and the internet's relative anonymity makes such personal attacks more difficult to stop than conventional bullying.


In light of this, this dataset comprises over 47000 tweets labeled with the following cyberbullying categories: Age, Ethnicity, Gender, Religion, Other sort of cyberbullying, Not cyberbullying.

Trigger Warning: These tweets either describe a bullying occurrence or are the crime itself; consequently, read them only if you are comfortable.
